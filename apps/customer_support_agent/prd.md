## 6. Narrative

A customer opens the app seeking help with a technical issue. The AI agent immediately greets them and begins understanding their problem through natural conversation. As the interaction progresses, the system detects the user's growing frustration and automatically searches the knowledge base for relevant solutions. When the AI determines the issue requires specialized human assistance, it smoothly transitions the conversation toward escalation while maintaining all context for the eventual human handoff, ensuring the customer feels heard, understood, and properly assisted throughout their support journey.

#### Code Examples & Templates

**System Prompt Template (Based on Anthropic Quickstart):**
```dart
// Adapted from: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/customer-support-agent/app/api/chat/route.ts#L133-L142
final systemPrompt = '''
You are acting as a customer support assistant chatbot. You are chatting with a human user who is asking for help about our products and services. When responding to the user, aim to provide concise and helpful responses while maintaining a polite and professional tone.

To help you answer the user's question, we have retrieved the following information for you:
\${isKnowledgeAvailable ? retrievedContext : "No information found for this query."}

Please provide responses that only use the information you have been given. If no information is available or if the information is not relevant for answering the question, you can redirect the user to a human agent for further assistance.

To display your responses correctly, you must format your entire response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "thinking": "Brief explanation of your reasoning for how you should address the user's query",
  "response": "Your concise response to the user",
  "user_mood": "positive|neutral|negative|curious|frustrated|confused",
  "suggested_questions": ["Question 1?", "Question 2?", "Question 3?"],
  "debug": {
    "context_used": true|false
  },
  "matched_categories": ["category_id1", "category_id2"],
  "redirect_to_agent": {
    "should_redirect": boolean,
    "reason": "Reason for redirection (optional, include only if should_redirect is true)"
  }
}
''';
```

**JSON Response Schema (Zod equivalent for Dart validation):**
```dart
// Based on: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/customer-support-agent/app/api/chat/route.ts#L26-L59
class CustomerSupportResponse {
  final String thinking;
  final String response;
  final String userMood; // positive, neutral, negative, curious, frustrated, confused
  final List<String> suggestedQuestions;
  final Map<String, bool> debug;
  final List<String> matchedCategories;
  final RedirectToAgent redirectToAgent;
  
  // Validation and JSON serialization methods
}
```
